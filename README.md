# 🕵️ Motion Detection Alarm System 🔔  

A real-time **motion detection alarm system** built with **Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and Pygame**.  
This project turns your webcam into a simple security system that can:  

- Detect motion in front of the camera.  
- Trigger a loud alarm when motion is detected while in **black screen mode** (surveillance mode).  
- Let you monitor in **normal mode** with live video feed and motion bounding boxes.  

It’s a lightweight yet powerful project that demonstrates **computer vision, frame differencing, and multimedia handling in Python**.  
You can use it as a **security system prototype**, a **motion detection learning project**, or a **fun personal experiment**.

## 🚀 Features  

- ✅ **Real-time motion detection** using frame differencing.  
- ✅ **Alarm system** that plays continuously until motion stops.  
- ✅ **Black screen mode** for hidden surveillance with white contours showing only motion areas.  
- ✅ **Normal mode** for monitoring with green bounding boxes.  
- ✅ Simple keyboard controls (`t` and `q`) for ease of use.  
- ✅ Built entirely with **open-source Python libraries**.
